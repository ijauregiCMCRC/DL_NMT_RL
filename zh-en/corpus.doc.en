Scaremongers play on the idea that robots will simply replace people on the job.

Eli Beer: The fastest ambulance? A motorcycle
As a young EMT on a Jerusalem ambulance, Eli Beer realized that, stuck in brutal urban traffic, they often arrived too late to help.

Ramanan Laxminarayan: The coming crisis in antibiotics
Antibiotic drugs save lives. But we simply use them too much — and often for non-lifesaving purposes, like treating the flu and even raising cheaper chickens. The result, says researcher Ramanan Laxminarayan, is that the drugs will stop working for everyone, as the bacteria they target grow more and more resistant.
