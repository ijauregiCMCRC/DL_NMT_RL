# DL_NMT_RL
Document-Level Neural Machine Translation with Reinforcement Learning, using discourse rewards.

Code used for the experiments in the paper titled: _Leveraging Discourse Rewards for Document-Level
Neural Machine Translation_.

This project has been developed by modifying the the source code released by Miculicich et al. (2018), which at the
same time has been based on OpenNMT-py (Klein et al., 2017)

## Requirements

The code requires the following packages:


```
nltk==3.4.5
scikit-learn==0.22.1
torch==1.1.0
torchtext==0.5.0
tqdm==4.42.1
bert-score==0.3.1
```

They can be installed running the following command with pip:

'''python
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
